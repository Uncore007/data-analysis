# Overview

Developed a simple data analysis example, using pandas and matplot to learn more about data analysis using Python.

In this specific example, we are analyzing a dataset from 1000 students relating to their acadedmic performance and their lifestyle/study habits.

The purpose of analyzing this data is to identify what habits or decisions can have the greatest impact on performance in school, in positive and negative ways.

# Data Analysis Results

What lifestyle/study habits have the greatest positive corelation with higher test scores?

What lifestyle/study habits have the greatest negative corelation with higher test scores?

# Development Environment

This tool uses Python, pandas and matplotlib modules
